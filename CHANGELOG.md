    -   `WPPopulationConfig.get_data_unit_paths` now correctly returns the original `.zip` URLs to trigger the download/extraction process when filtered `.tif` files are missing.
    -   After successful download and extraction, it now accurately identifies and returns the paths to the local `.tif` files, allowing `BaseHandler` to confirm availability and proceed with loading.
-   **WorldPop: `list index out of range` when no datasets found**:
    -   Added a `RuntimeError` in `WPPopulationConfig.get_relevant_data_units_by_country` when `self.client.search_datasets` returns no results, providing a clearer error message with the search parameters.

-   **OSMLocationFetcher Enhancements:**
    -   **Historical Data Fetching (`fetch_locations_changed_between`):**
        -   New method `fetch_locations_changed_between()` to retrieve OSM objects that were created or modified within a specified date range. This enables historical analysis and change tracking.
        -   Defaults `include_metadata` to `True` for this method, as it's typically used for change tracking.
    -   **Comprehensive OSM Country Information (`get_osm_countries`):**
        -   New static method `get_osm_countries()` to fetch country-level administrative boundaries directly from the OSM database.
        -   Supports fetching all countries or a specific country by ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code.
        -   Option to include various name variants (e.g., `name:en`, `official_name`) and ISO codes.
    -   **Metadata Inclusion in Fetched Locations:**
        -   Added `include_metadata` parameter to `fetch_locations()` to optionally retrieve change tracking metadata (timestamp, version, changeset, user, uid) for each fetched OSM element.
        -   This metadata is now extracted and included in the DataFrame for nodes, relations, and ways.
    -   **Flexible Date Filtering in Overpass Queries:**
        -   Introduced `date_filter_type` (`newer`, `changed`) and `start_date`/`end_date` parameters to `_build_queries()` for more granular control over time-based filtering in Overpass QL.
    -   **Date Normalization Utility:**

        -   `clip_to_bounds()`: New method to clip rasters to rectangular bounding boxes, supporting optional CRS transformation for the bounds.
        -   New helper methods for clipping: `_prepare_geometry_for_clipping()`, `_validate_geometry_crs()`, `_create_clipped_processor()`.

-   **WorldPopDownloader Zip Handling:**
    -   Modified `download_data_unit` in `WPPopulationDownloader` to correctly handle `.zip` files (e.g., school age datasets) by downloading them to a temporary location and extracting the contained `.tif` files.
    -   Updated `download_data_units` to correctly flatten the list of paths returned by `download_data_unit` when zip extraction results in multiple files.
    -   Adjusted `WPPopulationConfig.get_data_unit_paths` to correctly identify and return paths for extracted `.tif` files from zip resources. It is now intelligently resolves paths. For school-age datasets, it returns paths to extracted `.tif` files if available; otherwise, it returns the original `.zip` path(s) to trigger download and extraction.
    -   Added filter support to `WPPopulationConfig.get_data_unit_paths` hence to the `WPPopulationHandler` for:
        -   School-age datasets: supports `sex` (e.g., "F", "M", "F_M") and `education_level` (e.g., "PRIMARY", "SECONDARY") filters on extracted `.tif` filenames.
        -   Non-school-age age_structures: supports `sex`, `ages`, `min_age`, and `max_age` filters on `.tif` filenames.
-   **WorldPop: Filtered aggregation in `GeometryBasedZonalViewGenerator.map_wp_pop`**:
    -   `map_wp_pop` now enforces a single country input when `handler.config.project` is "age_structures".
    -   When `predicate` is "centroid_within" and the project is "age_structures", individual `TifProcessor` objects (representing age/sex combinations) are loaded, sampled with `map_rasters(stat="sum")`, and their results are summed per zone, preventing unintended merging.

-   **PoiViewGenerator: Filtered aggregation in `PoiViewGenerator.map_wp_pop`**:
    -   `map_wp_pop` now enforces a single country input when `handler.config.project` is "age_structures".
    -   When `predicate` is "centroid_within" and the project is "age_structures", individual `TifProcessor` objects (representing age/sex combinations) are loaded, sampled with `map_zonal_stats(stat="sum")`, and their results are summed per POI, preventing unintended merging.

-   **TifProcessor Multi-Raster Merging in Handlers and Generators:**
    -   Extended `_load_raster_data` in `BaseHandlerReader` to support an optional `merge_rasters` argument. When `True` and multiple raster paths are provided, `TifProcessor` now merges them into a single `TifProcessor` object during loading.
    -   Integrated `merge_rasters` argument into `GHSLDataReader` and `WPPopulationReader`'s `load_from_paths` and `load` methods, enabling control over raster merging at the reader level.
    -   Propagated `merge_rasters` to `GHSLDataHandler`'s `load_into_dataframe`, and `load_into_geodataframe` methods for consistent behavior across the handler interface.

### Changed

-   **TifProcessor**
    -   **Unified DataFrame Conversion:**
        -   Refactored `to_dataframe()` to act as a universal entry point, dynamically routing to internal, more efficient methods for single and multi-band processing.
        -   Deprecated the individual `_to_band_dataframe()`, `_to_rgb_dataframe()`, `_to_rgba_dataframe()`, and `_to_multi_band_dataframe()` methods in favor of the new unified `_to_dataframe()`.
        -   `to_dataframe()` now includes a `check_memory` parameter.
    -   **Optimized `open_dataset` Context Manager:**
        -   The `open_dataset` context manager now directly opens local files when `LocalDataStore` is used, avoiding unnecessary `rasterio.MemoryFile` creation for improved performance and reduced memory overhead.
    -   **Enhanced `to_geodataframe` and `to_graph`:**
        -   Added `check_memory` parameter to `to_geodataframe()` and `to_graph()` for memory pre-checks.
    -   **Refined `sample_by_polygons_batched`:**
        -   Included `check_memory` parameter for memory checks before batch processing.
        -   Implemented platform-specific warnings for potential multiprocessing issues on Windows/macOS.
    -   **Improved Multiprocessing Initialization:**
        -   The `_initializer_worker()` method now prioritizes merged, reprojected, or original local file paths for opening, ensuring workers access the most relevant data.
    -   **Modular Masking and Coordinate Extraction:**
        -   Introduced new private helper methods: `_extract_coordinates_with_mask()`, `_build_data_mask()`, `_build_multi_band_mask()`, and `_bands_to_dict()` to centralize and improve data masking and coordinate extraction logic.
    -   **Streamlined Band-Mode Validation:**
        -   Moved the logic for validating `mode` and band count compatibility into a dedicated `_validate_mode_band_compatibility()` method for better code organization.

-   **GigaSchoolLocationFetcher**
    -   `fetch_locations()` method:
        -   Added `process_geospatial` parameter (defaults to `False`) to optionally process geospatial data and return a `gpd.GeoDataFrame`.
    -   `_process_geospatial_data()` method:
        -   Modified to return a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` by converting the `pd.DataFrame` with a `geometry` column and `EPSG:4326` CRS.

-   **OSMLocationFetcher Refactoring:**
    -   **Unified Query Execution and Processing:** Refactored the core logic for executing Overpass queries and processing their results into a new private method `_execute_and_process_queries()`. This centralizes common steps and reduces code duplication between `fetch_locations()` and the new `fetch_locations_changed_between()`.
    -   **Enhanced `_build_queries`:** Modified `_build_queries` to accept `date_filter_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `include_metadata` to construct more dynamic and feature-rich Overpass QL queries.
    -   **Updated `fetch_locations` Signature:**
        -   Replaced `since_year` parameter with `since_date` (which can be a `str` or `datetime` object) for more precise time-based filtering.
        -   Added `include_metadata` parameter.
    -   **Improved Logging of Category Distribution:**
        -   Modified the logging for category distribution to correctly handle cases where categories are combined into a list (when `handle_duplicates='combine'`).
    -   **`since_year` Parameter:** Removed `since_year` from `fetch_locations()` as its functionality is now superseded by the more flexible `since_date` parameter and the `_build_queries` enhancements.

-   **`PoiViewGenerator` Mapping Methods (`map_zonal_stats`, `map_nearest_points`, `map_google_buildings`, `map_ms_buildings`, `map_built_s`, `map_smod`):**
    -   Changed `map_zonal_stats` and `map_nearest_points` to return `pd.DataFrame` results (including `'poi_id'` and new mapped columns) instead of directly updating the internal view.
    -   Updated `map_google_buildings`, `map_ms_buildings`, `map_built_s`, and `map_smod` to capture the `pd.DataFrame` returned by their respective underlying mapping calls (`map_nearest_points` or `map_zonal_stats`) and then explicitly call `self._update_view()` with these results.
    -   This enhances modularity and allows for more flexible result handling and accumulation.

-   **`ZonalViewGenerator.map_rasters` Enhancements:**
    -   Modified `map_rasters` to accept `raster_data` as either a single `TifProcessor` or a `List[TifProcessor]`.
    -   Implemented internal merging of `List[TifProcessor]` into a single `TifProcessor` before performing zonal statistics.
    -   Replaced `sample_multiple_tifs_by_polygons` with the `TifProcessor.sample_by_polygons` method.

### Fixed

-   **TifProcessor**:
    -   **`to_graph()` Sparse Matrix Creation:**
        -   Corrected the sparse matrix creation logic in `to_graph()` to ensure proper symmetric graph representation when `graph_type="sparse"`.
    -   **Coordinate System Handling in `_initializer_worker`:**
        -   Ensured that `_initializer_worker` correctly handles different data storage scenarios to provide the correct dataset handle to worker processes, preventing `RuntimeError` due to uninitialized raster datasets.

### Removed

-   **OSMLocationFetcher**
    -   **Redundant Category Distribution Logging:** Removed the explicit category distribution logging for `handle_duplicates == "separate"` since the `value_counts()` method on the 'category' column already provides this.

- **H3 Grid Generation**
    - **H3 Grid Generation Module (`gigaspatial/grid/h3.py`):**
        - Introduced `H3Hexagons` class for managing H3 cell IDs.
        - Supports creation from lists of hexagons, geographic bounds, spatial geometries, or points.
        - Provides methods to convert H3 hexagons to pandas DataFrames and GeoPandas GeoDataFrames.
        - Includes functionalities for filtering, getting k-ring neighbors, compacting hexagons, and getting children/parents at different resolutions.
        - Allows saving H3Hexagons to JSON, Parquet, or GeoJSON files.
    - **Country-Specific H3 Hexagons (`CountryH3Hexagons`):**
        - Extends `H3Hexagons` for generating H3 grids constrained by country boundaries.
        - Integrates with `AdminBoundaries` to fetch country geometries for precise H3 cell generation.

### Changed

- **TifProcessor**
  - **Improved Temporary File Management:** Refactored temporary file handling for merging and reprojection using `tempfile.mkdtemp()` and `shutil.rmtree` for more robust and reliable cleanup. Integrated with context manager (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) and added a dedicated `cleanup()` method.
  - **Reprojection during Initialization:** Implemented automatic reprojection of single rasters to a specified `target_crs` during `TifProcessor` initialization.
  - **Enhanced `open_dataset` Context Manager:** The `open_dataset` context manager now intelligently opens the most up-to-date (merged or reprojected) version of the dataset.
  - **More Flexible Multi-Dataset Validation:** Modified `_validate_multiple_datasets` to issue a warning instead of raising an error for CRS mismatches when `target_crs` is not set.
  - **Optimized `_get_reprojection_profile`:** Dynamically calculates transform and dimensions based on `reprojection_resolution` and added LZW compression to reprojected TIFF files to reduce file size.

- **ADLSDataStore Enhancements**
    - **New `copy_file` method:** Implemented a new method for copying individual files within ADLS, with an option to overwrite existing files.
    - **New `rename` method:** Added a new method to rename (move) files in ADLS, which internally uses `copy_file` and then deletes the source, with options for overwrite, waiting for copy completion, and polling.
    - **Revamped `rmdir` method:** Modified `rmdir` to perform batch deletions of blobs, addressing the Azure Blob batch delete limit (256 sub-requests) and improving efficiency for large directories.

- **LocalDataStore Enhancements**
    - **New `copy_file` method:** Implemented a new method for copying individual files.
