# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.6.8] - 2025-07-26

### Added

- **OSMLocationFetcher Enhancements**
  - Support for querying OSM locations by arbitrary administrative levels (e.g., states, provinces, cities), in addition to country-level queries.
  - New optional parameters:
    - `admin_level`: Specify OSM administrative level (e.g., 4 for states, 6 for counties).
    - `admin_value`: Name of the administrative area to query (e.g., "California").
  - New static method `get_admin_names(admin_level, country=None)`:
    - Fetch all administrative area names for a given `admin_level`, optionally filtered by country.
    - Helps users discover valid admin area names for constructing precise queries.

- **Multi-Raster Merging Support in TifProcessor**
  - Added ability to initialize `TifProcessor` with **multiple raster datasets**.
  - Merges rasters on load with configurable strategies:
    - Supported `merge_method` options: `first`, `last`, `min`, `max`, `mean`.
  - Supports **on-the-fly reprojection** for rasters with differing coordinate reference systems via `target_crs`.
  - Handles **resampling** using `resampling_method` (default: `nearest`).
  - Comprehensive validation to ensure compatibility of input rasters (e.g., resolution, nodata, dtype).
  - Temporary file management for merged output with automatic cleanup.
  - Backward compatible with single-raster use cases.

  **New TifProcessor Parameters:**
  - `merge_method` (default: `first`) – How to combine pixel values across rasters.
  - `target_crs` (optional) – CRS to reproject rasters before merging.
  - `resampling_method` – Resampling method for reprojection.

  **New Properties:**
  - `is_merged`: Indicates whether the current instance represents merged rasters.
  - `source_count`: Number of raster datasets merged.

### Changed
